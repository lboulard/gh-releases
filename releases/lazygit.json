      "description": "<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at v0.53.0 -->\r\n\r\nThis is the first lazygit release after Jesse [passed the maintainership to me](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/issues/4655) (@stefanhaller), and I'm excited (and a little bit nervous \ud83d\ude04) about it.\r\n\r\nNo big new features this time, but lots of smaller quality-of-life improvements. The one that makes the biggest difference for me is an improved hunk selection mode in the staging view (in case you didn't know, you can switch from the normal line selection mode to hunk mode by pressing `a`). This now works a bit more fine-grained, by selecting groups of added or deleted lines rather than entire hunks, which often consist of several such groups. With this change I find that I prefer hunk mode over line mode in most cases, so I added a user config to switch to hunk automatically upon entering the staging view; it is off by default, but I encourage you to enable it (`gui.useHunkModeInStagingView`) to see if you like it as much as I do. Feedback about this is welcome; please comment on [the PR](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4684) if you have any.\r\n\r\nThe detailed list of all changes follows:\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Add option to disable warning when amending last commit by @johnhamlin in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4640\r\n* Add bold style for border by @aidancz in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4644\r\n* Add credential prompts for PKCS11-based SSH keys by @Jadeiin in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4646\r\n* Show annotation information for selected tag by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4663\r\n* Show stash name for selected stash by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4673\r\n* Auto-stash modified files when cherry-picking or reverting commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4683\r\n* Move to next stageable line when adding a line to a custom patch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4675\r\n* Improve hunk selection mode in staging view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4684\r\n* Add user config to use hunk mode by default when entering staging view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4685\r\n### Fixes \ud83d\udd27\r\n* Fix stash operations when branch named 'stash' exists by @ChrisMcD1 in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4641\r\n* Fix moving a custom patch from the very first commit of the history to a later commit by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4631\r\n* Fix DEFAULT_REMOTE_ICON character code by @bedlamzd in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4653\r\n* Show GPG error before entering commit editor when rewording non-latest commits by @m04f in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4660\r\n* Fix branch head icon appearing at head commit when a remote or tag exists with the same name as the current branch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4669\r\n* Fix applying custom patches to a dirty working tree by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4674\r\n* Collapse selection after deleting a range of branches or stashes by @nileric in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4661\r\n### Maintenance \u2699\ufe0f\r\n* Instantiate mutexes by value by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4632\r\n* Bump github.com/cloudflare/circl from 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4633\r\n* Update linter by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4671\r\n* Some code cleanups to the \"discard file changes from commit\" feature by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4679\r\n* Change Refresh to not return an error by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4680\r\n### Docs \ud83d\udcd6\r\n* Fix formatting of a keyboard shortcut in the README.md by @DanOpcode in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4678\r\n### I18n \ud83c\udf0e\r\n* Update translations from Crowdin by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4686\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @johnhamlin made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4640\r\n* @aidancz made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4644\r\n* @bedlamzd made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4653\r\n* @Jadeiin made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4646\r\n* @m04f made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4660\r\n* @DanOpcode made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4678\r\n* @nileric made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4661\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.52.0...v0.53.0\r\n\r\n",
