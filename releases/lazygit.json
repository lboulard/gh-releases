      "description": "We've got a whole lot of stuff in this release: improvements to the editor, better custom commands support, snappier staging of files, a tonne of bug fixes, and lots more.\r\n\r\nOne particularly cool thing that we've added is Github codespaces support (in the repo, not within the Lazygit program itself), so if you've got your eye on an open issue and want to move things along, consider spinning up the lazygit codebase in a code_space_ and having a go at adding a feature / fixing a bug all from the comfort of your browser! See [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-in-a-github-codespace) for more info.\r\n\r\nAs you can see @Ryooooooga and @mark2185 continue to kick goals with a heap of features and bug fixes in this release, but we also have a whole host of new contributors too. If you want to get involved in contributing, you can peruse the issues board for issues with the good-first-issue label, or jump into the [Fortress of Laziness](https://discord.gg/4FhUY75c), our new discord server\r\n\r\n# What's Changed\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n\r\n### Editor stuff\r\n* add support for excluding files by @gozes in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2016\r\n* add support
