      "description": "<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at v0.58.1 -->\r\n\r\nThis is a hotfix release that fixes the known issues with 0.58.\r\n\r\nTo expand on this a bit: in 0.58 we updated our TUI library tcell to a new version that made significant under-the-hood changes; this allowed us to fix several rendering issues, mostly related to wide characters like some emojis. Apart from that, there are few user visible changes with this update, but it lays the ground for future enhancements like support for more keybindings.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the changes are so fundamental it also introduced a number of regressions, and I'm not really surprised about that. Most of these were bugs in tcell that have been fixed upstream now, but some were on our side. This release fixes the ones I know about. If you still have issues, please report them!\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Update search position (match x of y) when changing the selection in a list view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5169\r\n### Fixes \ud83d\udd27\r\n* When doing ctrl-f, and the resulting commit is not visible, scroll it into view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5182\r\n* Fix pasting multi-line text into the commit description by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5186\r\n* Fix keypad keys, and pasting emojis in Windows Terminal by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5192\r\n* Don't log the \"git ls-remote\" call when opening a PR by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5195\r\n* Fix rendering artefacts after double-width characters (e.g. \"\u26a0\ufe0f\") on some terminals by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5198\r\n### Maintenance \u2699\ufe0f\r\n* Request info about terminal in issue template by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/5194\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.58.0...v0.58.1\r\n\r\n",
